# scraper
# Draft 2 Scrapes and parses the HTML on Newegg, based on a query, and prints out each item inside the terminal.

# Draft 3 Does the same as Draft 2, but instead of printing each item in the terminal, the program creates an HTML file.
# ^ Also added a while not statement if price values aren't integers.

# Draft 4 is currently in progress. The end result should be a scraper with classes for input query and scraping Newegg.com.
